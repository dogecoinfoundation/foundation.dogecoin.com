A number of concerned Shibes from the Dogecoin community have recently brought to our attention the 'Dogecoin 2.0' 
crypto project, which began earlier this year and has just announced listings on prominent exchanges.

As always, the Dogecoin Foundation welcomes newcomers to the crypto space but this project has no connection to or 
relationship with Dogecoin.  To protect the Dogecoin community from being misled and to protect the Dogecoin name 
from possible misuse we have asked our brand protection lawyers to contact the developers of the 'Dogecoin 2.0' 
product.

We hope our reasonable request will see their development team select a new name for their project which does not 
infringe on the rights and reputation of the Dogecoin project, and we look forward to any innovations they may make 
in their future endeavours.
