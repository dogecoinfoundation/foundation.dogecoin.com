The Dogecoin community is heartbroken for the loss of a very good Shibe. <a href="https://twitter.com/nl_dogecoin" target="_blank">nl_dogecoin</a> was enthusiastic in his support of all that embodies the Doge spirit; buidling, memes, and overall silliness; most importantly a friend to many, all of who will remember him fondly and miss him always.
