# Introduction

The Dogecoin Foundation has been hard at work building out the fundamental 
building blocks required for the future of the Dogecoin ecosystem. Since 2022
we have been focused on building developer features and integration tools
which have been successfully used by a number of teams to build new Dogecoin 
projects. We are now preparing to move forward, building on top of these building
blocks to develop new tools and services for Dogecoin to improve scalability 
and suitability as a global currency.

#### What we've been doing 

In [the 2022 trailmap](/trailmap/prologue/) we identified a number of key areas 
of development deficit that needed to be addressed before we would be able to 
begin developing the features we beleive will establish Dogecoin as a viable 
global currency for all humanity.

These projects: [libdogecoin](https://lib.dogecoin.org): a standard ANSI C library
for building Dogecoin projects, [GigaWallet](https://gigawallet.dogecoin.org): a 
backend for Dogecoin payments at scale and [Radio Doge](https://radio.dogecoin.org):
Access to Dogecoin for 1.4bn unbanked, establish the foundational building blocks 
for our next set of projects aimed at building utility and scalability into the 
Dogecoin ecosystem.
