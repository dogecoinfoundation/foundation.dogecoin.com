The 0.1.4 release consolidates everything that’s been in progress since then—including Intel and ARM performance enhancements, REST API extensions for the SPV node, expanded secure enclave support, and the introduction of YubiKey hardware key storage. This post provides a high-level summary of these developments and links to documentation for those looking to integrate or build on top of Libdogecoin.</description></item><item><title>We Mourn The Passing Of Kabosu, The Beloved Shiba Inu Who Inspired The Doge Meme And Dogecoin Cryptocurrency.</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2024-05-24-kabosu-obituary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2024-05-24-kabosu-obituary/</guid><description>We Mourn The Passing Of Kabosu, The Beloved Shiba Inu Who Inspired The Doge Meme And Dogecoin Cryptocurrency. DogeミームとDogecoin暗号通貨に影響を与えた最愛の柴犬、かぼすの死を悼み追悼を捧げます。 London, UK, May 24th, 2024 — It is with great sadness that the Dogecoin Foundation received news of the passing of Kabosu, the beloved shiba inu who inspired the Doge meme and our eponymous cryptocurrency Dogecoin. At the age of 18, Kabosu lived a full and storied life, leaving an indelible mark in the world.</description></item><item><title>Development Blog - February 2024</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2024-02-09-devblog/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2024-02-09-devblog/</guid><description>Happy New Year, Shibes! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since our last blog post, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been busy getting libdogecoin ready for release, as well as working on some other exciting projects. Last year was significant, with the release and continuous improvement of our key initiatives: GigaWallet, LibDogecoin, and RadioDoge. This year, we&amp;rsquo;re enhancing these projects and introducing new ones, which will be announced next week on a freshly updated Trailmap. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to share what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to and what&amp;rsquo;s coming up in 2024.</description></item><item><title>Development Blog 27th September 2023</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2023-09-27-devblog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2023-09-27-devblog/</guid><description>Happy September Shibes! We’ve been busy working on a number of things, and we wanted to share some of the progress we’ve made. The last blog contained bullet points of the things we were working on. In this post we’ll go into more detail on some of the items, and we’ll also share some new things that we’ve been working on.

Not entirely sure if the format will remain the same as we go but it’s a start!
Here’s an overview of the last 2 weeks:

That said there’s been a growing anxiety in the community around a couple of topics which have been taken far out of proportion by a small number of people who seem intent on dividing the community rather than working toward consensus.</description></item><item><title>Oona wants to say a thing</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-14-oonabot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-14-oonabot/</guid><description>In the spirit of improving communications and transparency I’d like to take the opportunity to rip the Band-Aid off and let it be known that I have been a volunteer with the Dogecoin Foundation for the past six months. Some of you may remember that in June around my birthday I was invited by members of the Foundation for dinner in Austin. It was an absolutely amazing evening getting to know these people in person.</description></item><item><title>Shibes raise more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) to build a statue of the Doge!</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</guid><description>In celebration of Kabosu the Doge&amp;rsquo;s 17th birthday, shibes around the world have raised more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) in donations which will be used to create a bronze statue of Kabosu in her home city of Sakura, Japan. Kabosu&amp;rsquo;s owner, Atsuko Sato was kind enough to reach out to Sakura city council, who support the idea of including the statue in their 2024 project to revitalise Furusato Square.
The funds which were raised have been moved into a multisignature wallet and now the work to make the statue of our beloved Doge a reality begins.</description></item><item><title>Shanties, RadioDoge &amp; Financial Freedom</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-04-11-shanty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-04-11-shanty/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the rousing tale of the whalers from Otakou and the Weller Bros trading company that plied its wares amongst them during the 1800s.
What you may not know is that the workers in these stories were often enticed with promises of a good wage, only to find themselves intentionally indebted to trading cooperatives who controlled 100% of the housing, equipment, trade and basic necessities in these remote regions.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about Development</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</guid><description>I know that for non-devs (or ‘not-yet-devs&amp;rsquo; 😉), it can sometimes be difficult to make sense of technical talk. I think that a part of my job as an Engineer at the Dogecoin Foundation is to explain technical things in terms non-tech folk can understand. Because of this, I’d like to ramble a bit about the Trailmap, about the goals we have and the projects that we’re hoping will fulfil them.</description></item></channel></rss>
