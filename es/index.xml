The 0.1.4 release consolidates everything that’s been in progress since then—including Intel and ARM performance enhancements, REST API extensions for the SPV node, expanded secure enclave support, and the introduction of YubiKey hardware key storage. This post provides a high-level summary of these developments and links to documentation for those looking to integrate or build on top of Libdogecoin.</description></item><item><title>We Mourn The Passing Of Kabosu, The Beloved Shiba Inu Who Inspired The Doge Meme And Dogecoin Cryptocurrency.</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2024-05-24-kabosu-obituary/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2024-05-24-kabosu-obituary/</guid><description>We Mourn The Passing Of Kabosu, The Beloved Shiba Inu Who Inspired The Doge Meme And Dogecoin Cryptocurrency.

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since our last blog post, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been busy getting libdogecoin ready for release, as well as working on some other exciting projects. Last year was significant, with the release and continuous improvement of our key initiatives: GigaWallet, LibDogecoin, and RadioDoge. This year, we&amp;rsquo;re enhancing these projects and introducing new ones, which will be announced next week on a freshly updated Trailmap. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to share what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to and what&amp;rsquo;s coming up in 2024.</description></item><item><title>Development Blog 27th September 2023</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2023-09-27-devblog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2023-09-27-devblog/</guid><description>Happy September Shibes! We’ve been busy working on a number of things, and we wanted to share some of the progress we’ve made. The last blog contained bullet points of the things we were working on. In this post we’ll go into more detail on some of the items, and we’ll also share some new things that we’ve been working on.

Not entirely sure if the format will remain the same as we go but it’s a start!
Here’s an overview of the last 2 weeks:

We are happy to announce the institution of a new community Dogecoin Core development fund, managed by existing core developers and Dogecoin Foundation board director signatories, along with transparency blog posts forthcoming for all expenditures and developments. The Dogecoin Foundation has taken the step of moving 5,000,000 Dogecoin to the development fund, with the intent that this will be allocated to Dogecoin Core, the development of which is critical and to the benefit of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Fantoumi's questions</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-20-fantoumi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-20-fantoumi/</guid><description>2022 has been a busy time for the Dogecoin Foundation, there have been solid developments and improvements within the Dogecoin Ecosystem, we’ve had a hugely successful Hackathon that’s seen many new people introduced to Dogecoin development, and we’ve been able to grow our team through the kind generosity of some big Shibes who are aligned with our mission and want to see us succeed.
That said there’s been a growing anxiety in the community around a couple of topics which have been taken far out of proportion by a small number of people who seem intent on dividing the community rather than working toward consensus.</description></item><item><title>Oona wants to say a thing</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-14-oonabot/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-14-oonabot/</guid><description>In the spirit of improving communications and transparency I’d like to take the opportunity to rip the Band-Aid off and let it be known that I have been a volunteer with the Dogecoin Foundation for the past six months. Some of you may remember that in June around my birthday I was invited by members of the Foundation for dinner in Austin. It was an absolutely amazing evening getting to know these people in person.</description></item><item><title>Shibes raise more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) to build a statue of the Doge!</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</guid><description>In celebration of Kabosu the Doge&amp;rsquo;s 17th birthday, shibes around the world have raised more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) in donations which will be used to create a bronze statue of Kabosu in her home city of Sakura, Japan. Kabosu&amp;rsquo;s owner, Atsuko Sato was kind enough to reach out to Sakura city council, who support the idea of including the statue in their 2024 project to revitalise Furusato Square.
The funds which were raised have been moved into a multisignature wallet and now the work to make the statue of our beloved Doge a reality begins.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation to join the wDoge DAO</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/announcements/2022-09-12-wdoge-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/es/announcements/2022-09-12-wdoge-bridge/</guid><description>You may have heard talk about bridges in crypto, and recently in relation to Dogecoin.If you search around online for bridges to any major blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum you’ll find plenty of them.
So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin? Much like a physical bridge connects two locations, a crypto bridge connects two blockchains together to allow interaction: usually to allow one coin to be used on the other side of the bridge.</description></item></channel></rss>
