I think that a part of my job as an Engineer at the Dogecoin Foundation is to explain technical things in terms non-tech folk can understand. Because of this, I’d like to ramble a bit about the Trailmap, about the goals we have and the projects that we’re hoping will fulfil them.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation Update &amp; AMA on January 23rd, 2022</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</guid><description>The Dogecoin Foundation, established and led by members of the original core development team and long-time members of the Dogecoin community, has responsibility for providing governance and support for the Dogecoin cryptocurrency project.
Since 2014, the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s sole mission has been to protect and support the Dogecoin project, its reputation, and the global community of Shibes. The Foundation is committed to ensuring that Dogecoin continues to thrive, and can ultimately scale to being a widely used currency whilst simultaneously tackling changes at a pace that keeps-up with other cryptocurrencies.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Trailmap: Prologue</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/prologue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/trailmap/prologue/</guid><description>Dogecoin Trailmap: Prologue Dogecoin Trailmap: Prologue Project: Dogecoin.com makeover &amp;amp; Dogepedia Project: Libdogecoin Project: Dogecoin Standard Project: GigaWallet Project: Dogecoin Keyring (App / SDK) Project: RadioDoge (Starlink + Radio nodes for remote locations) Proposal: Community Staking (Proof of Stake) Partnership: Point of Sale (L2 app) What is the Dogecoin Trailmap?

It has been edited to clarify.
Binance has today paused Dogecoin withdrawals and stated they have found a &amp;ldquo;minor issue&amp;rdquo; in Dogecoin. The Foundation wishes to address this:
Several months ago (noting while an earlier post stated a year, first confirmed mention is April) Binance notified a group of Dogecoin Core maintainers that Binance had cases where transactions were stuck, meaning the transactions were not being mined successfully.</description></item><item><title>Statement Concerning the 'Dogecoin 2.0' crypto project</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2021-08-31-advisory-dogecoin2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2021-08-31-advisory-dogecoin2/</guid><description>A number of concerned Shibes from the Dogecoin community have recently brought to our attention the &amp;lsquo;Dogecoin 2.0&amp;rsquo; crypto project, which began earlier this year and has just announced listings on prominent exchanges.
As always, the Dogecoin Foundation welcomes newcomers to the crypto space but this project has no connection to or relationship with Dogecoin. To protect the Dogecoin community from being misled and to protect the Dogecoin name from possible misuse we have asked our brand protection lawyers to contact the developers of the &amp;lsquo;Dogecoin 2.</description></item><item><title>Claims of Affiliation with Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2020-08-18-not-affiliated-moonrabbit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/advisories/2020-08-18-not-affiliated-moonrabbit/</guid><description>Neither the Dogecoin project, the Dogecoin Foundation or any affiliated developers or entities have partnered with MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu or any affiliated entities, including the purported Dogecoin Foundation using the domain doge.org. This purported organisation and domain are, as far as we have been able to ascertain, run by the same people who run MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu.
As such, any claim of &amp;ldquo;partnering up&amp;rdquo; appears to be designed to create a false appearance of partnership and association with the long-established Dogecoin project and Dogecoin Foundation.</description></item></channel></rss>
