step back from involvement in the Foundation as a Director and more generally from
active development in the crypto space.</p>
<p>While this is news to many in the community, Ross had made his intentions clear to
the Core developers almost a year ago and has been working quietly behind the scenes
to create a sustainable transition for his role in the Dogecoin project.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Ross has been instrumental in the re-establishment of the Dogecoin
Foundation in 2021. The Foundation has been set up to ensure that Dogecoin prospers
into the future through a diverse ecosystem of projects and teams, working in
collaboration toward making Dogecoin a long-term sustainable cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>While this may be seen as a loss for the Dogecoin Community, we believe that Ross'
ongoing involvement as an Advisor will free him up to play more of an advocacy role.
On behalf of the Dogecoin Foundation and the wider Dogecoin community, we salute Ross
for his tireless work on maintaining the Dogecoin dream for most of the last decade.</p>
<p>We will miss the top hat, the easy going British humour, and the boundless wisdom in
our day-to-day interactions, and we wish Ross a bright and happy future as he continues
to Do Only Good Everyday.</p>
<p>&ndash; The Dogecoin Foundation crew.</p>

<p>Since 2014, the Foundation&rsquo;s sole mission has been to protect and support the Dogecoin project,
its reputation, and the global community of Shibes. The Foundation is committed to ensuring that
Dogecoin continues to thrive, and can ultimately scale to being a widely used currency whilst
simultaneously tackling changes at a pace that keeps-up with other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>On January 23rd, 2022, three members of the Foundation, Michi Lumin, Ross Nicoll, and Tim Stebbing
will be participating in a video AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) with the community. The AMA will be live
streamed <a href="https://youtu.be/jctze9jZfTQ">here</a>. In anticipation of the AMA, a short update of recent Foundation
activities, all of which have been undertaken for the benefit of the Dogecoin community, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launching the first <a href="/trailmap/prologue/">Dogecoin Trailmap</a> to provide a vision for the future of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging with and consulting several potential commercial and non-commercial users of the GigaWallet project, gathering requirements and breaking ground on development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gathering a like-minded group of developers from the community interested in contributing to the Libdogecoin project and commencing development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a team of community website and translation volunteers who are working diligently on the upcoming dogecoin.com website and the ‘Dogepedia’ in multiple languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-boarding long-term and previously unpaid volunteers in key functions, treating those individuals fairly and ensuring that the Dogecoin ecosystem can be resourced consistently in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing good governance and compliance principles, working with legal, accounting, and tax advisors to ensure proper use of any Foundation funds only for the benefit of the Dogecoin community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting and promoting the use of Dogecoin for important charitable causes, for example with <a href="https://dogecoin.com/teamseas/">#TeamSeas</a>, helping remove more than 30,000,000 pounds of trash from the oceans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started collaborating with non-profits that share Dogecoin’s spirit of playful discovery and learning such as <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing hostile parties (including large corporates) from taking over or claiming ownership of Dogecoin through, e.g., bad faith trademark registrations; or to mislead the community by pretending to be Dogecoin or be affiliated with it. For example, please see our recent tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/DogecoinFdn/status/1484474892569305088?s=20">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that the Dogecoin name, logo, and memes remain available for the community to use freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liaising with the community, investors, technologists and other stakeholders around the world, to devise and implement opportunities for the cryptocurrency, to future-proof it for everyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, all of these actions have been taken to ensure that Dogecoin remains the People’s
cryptocurrency for years to come. The Foundation is dedicated, as always, to <strong>D</strong>oing <strong>O</strong>nly <strong>G</strong>ood <strong>E</strong>veryday.
The Foundation is currently putting together a note which will provide more detail regarding the Foundation’s
strategy, funding, and Tip Jar transactions. We look forward to sharing this information with you in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is not here to ‘take control’ of the <em>Dogecoin Core Wallet</em> project, which remains the primary reference implementation of a compliant Dogecoin Wallet. We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project.</p>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is also looking to the future of the broader Dogecoin ecosystem, and in coming weeks, will be announcing new projects that will compliment the current Core Wallet to enable faster integration and easier APIs for Financial, Social and Charitable projects wishing to use Dogecoin. We believe that the success of Dogecoin is through broad global adoption and utility, and intend to focus on projects that increase Dogecoin uptake at a grassroots level.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-the-dogecoin-brand">Protecting the Dogecoin Brand</h3>
<p>For many years, the Dogecoin community has continued to think the best of people and hoped that everyone could play nicely with the name and logos. Dogecoin belongs to the people after all.</p>
<p>However, in recent times, numerous attempts have been made to co-opt the &lsquo;Dogecoin&rsquo; brand in various jurisdictions, in ways that would prevent the community and the project itself using them.</p>
<p>Not many people know this, but we would like to commend one Very Good Shibe: Jens Wiechers, who since 2014 has single-handedly and at great personal expense fought these kinds of attacks through the trademark office under the banner of the Dogecoin Foundation to protect everyone’s right to use the Dogecoin brand.</p>
<p>The Foundation holds the Dogecoin mark and the Dogecoin Logo and will maintain them for the community. This will mean the Foundation can continue to protect the Dogecoin Brand and allow (under a very liberal license) the ability to use it for Dogecoin-related memes, projects and fun. — We’ve got your back on this one.</p>
<h3 id="the-dogecoin-manifesto">The Dogecoin Manifesto</h3>
<p>We have been thinking about what Dogecoin means: as a technical project and as a movement for good in the world. We’ve condensed it down to four statements that we are calling the Dogecoin Manifesto. Two are technically-focused and two are social.</p>
<p>We believe that together, these key pillars that embody ‘Do Only Good Everyday’ will guide us forward as we make decisions and advance the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/manifesto">The Dogecoin Manifesto</a></p>
<p>If you can, please ‘sign’ the Manifesto by clicking the tweet link at the bottom of the Manifesto page. This will let the world know what the Doge Army stands for!</p>
<h3 id="stop-collaborate-and-listen">Stop, collaborate and listen!</h3>
<p>One of the key tenets of the Manifesto is that we value <em>collaboration and trust</em> over <em>competition and exclusivity</em>. With that in mind, we have established a small, but intensely smart and amazing group of Advisors with experience in a range of areas who will be allies and advocates for Dogecoin as we seek to grow and develop the ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/about">Head on over and check out our amaze Advisors list</a>, and be sure to give them some love for offering their valuable time.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-success">The cost of success</h3>
<p>The Foundation re-launches with the help of many volunteers who have been working tirelessly over the past several months. We recognise, however, that Dogecoin (at time of writing a 44 billion dollar financial product) has grown in size beyond many organisations with thousands of employees.</p>
<p>It has come to the point that many of the people who have been working non-stop to make Dogecoin what it is today whilst holding down full-time day jobs have been burning out and struggling to deal with the flood of attention (good and bad) that Dogecoin has been receiving.</p>
<p>This comes at a cost. Talented new people come to the project hoping to help and there is no one to welcome them or help them find a way to contribute and so they leave frustrated. The documentation effort has stalled and potential patches sit un-reviewed while the limited time a small core of people have is focused on critical issues.</p>
<h3 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h3>
<p>We believe Dogecoin deserves the attention of a team of full-time contributors who can help carry the burden of these more mundane tasks that keep the Dogecoin project alive.</p>
<p>The Foundation has been preparing a budget and has received expressions of interest from a number of people who are able to contribute. We aim to build a group of annual sponsors who can cover Foundation activities and a modest development team.</p>
<p>Our Initial target is to secure a three-year budget so that we can on-board a minimum staff to improve Dogecoin full-time, without them having to worry about job security.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to support the Dogecoin Foundation through major sponsorship please reach out, we’d love to speak with you.</p>
<p></br></br>
Much love,  — The Dogecoin Foundation
