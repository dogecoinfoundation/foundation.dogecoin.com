So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin? Much like a physical bridge connects two locations, a crypto bridge connects two blockchains together to allow interaction: usually to allow one coin to be used on the other side of the bridge.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Inaugural Dogecoin Hackathon</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/</guid><description>G&amp;rsquo;day shibes everywhere!

After putting out the call for volunteers on Reddit and Twitter we gathered a group of around 20 Shibes with a wide variety of talents: from writing and translation, to HTML, CSS and graphic design.

What you may not know is that the workers in these stories were often enticed with promises of a good wage, only to find themselves intentionally indebted to trading cooperatives who controlled 100% of the housing, equipment, trade and basic necessities in these remote regions.</description></item><item><title>Ross Nicoll Stepping into an Advisor Role for the Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/announcements/2022-02-24-update-ross/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/announcements/2022-02-24-update-ross/</guid><description>Recently Ross made public his decision to step back from involvement in the Foundation as a Director and more generally from active development in the crypto space.
While this is news to many in the community, Ross had made his intentions clear to the Core developers almost a year ago and has been working quietly behind the scenes to create a sustainable transition for his role in the Dogecoin project.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about Development</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</guid><description>I know that for non-devs (or ‘not-yet-devs&amp;rsquo; 😉), it can sometimes be difficult to make sense of technical talk. I think that a part of my job as an Engineer at the Dogecoin Foundation is to explain technical things in terms non-tech folk can understand. Because of this, I’d like to ramble a bit about the Trailmap, about the goals we have and the projects that we’re hoping will fulfil them.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation Update &amp; AMA on January 23rd, 2022</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/no/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</guid><description>The Dogecoin Foundation, established and led by members of the original core development team and long-time members of the Dogecoin community, has responsibility for providing advocacy and support for the Dogecoin cryptocurrency project.
