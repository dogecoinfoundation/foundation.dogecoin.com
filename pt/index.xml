I think that a part of my job as an Engineer at the Dogecoin Foundation is to explain technical things in terms non-tech folk can understand. Because of this, I’d like to ramble a bit about the Trailmap, about the goals we have and the projects that we’re hoping will fulfil them.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation Update &amp; AMA on January 23rd, 2022</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</guid><description>The Dogecoin Foundation, established and led by members of the original core development team and long-time members of the Dogecoin community, has responsibility for providing governance and support for the Dogecoin cryptocurrency project.
Since 2014, the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s sole mission has been to protect and support the Dogecoin project, its reputation, and the global community of Shibes. The Foundation is committed to ensuring that Dogecoin continues to thrive, and can ultimately scale to being a widely used currency whilst simultaneously tackling changes at a pace that keeps-up with other cryptocurrencies.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Trailmap: Prologue</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/trailmap/prologue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/trailmap/prologue/</guid><description>Dogecoin Trailmap: Prologue Dogecoin Trailmap: Prologue Project: Dogecoin.com makeover &amp;amp; Dogepedia Project: Libdogecoin Project: Dogecoin Standard Project: GigaWallet Project: Dogecoin Keyring (App / SDK) Project: RadioDoge (Starlink + Radio nodes for remote locations) Proposal: Community Staking (Proof of Stake) Partnership: Point of Sale (L2 app) What is the Dogecoin Trailmap?

It has been edited to clarify.
Binance has today paused Dogecoin withdrawals and stated they have found a &amp;ldquo;minor issue&amp;rdquo; in Dogecoin. The Foundation wishes to address this:
Several months ago (noting while an earlier post stated a year, first confirmed mention is April) Binance notified a group of Dogecoin Core maintainers that Binance had cases where transactions were stuck, meaning the transactions were not being mined successfully.</description></item><item><title>Conselho: Comunicado em relação ao projeto cripto 'Dogecoin 2.0'</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/advisories/2021-08-31-advisory-dogecoin2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/advisories/2021-08-31-advisory-dogecoin2/</guid><description>Alguns Shibes preocupados da comunidade Dogecoin recentemente trouxeram à nossa atenção o projeto cripto &amp;lsquo;Dogecoin 2.0&amp;rsquo;, que começou no início deste ano e acabou de anunciar que vai ser listado em exchanges de renome.
Como de costume, a Fundação Dogecoin dá as boas vindas aos recém-chegados ao espaço cripto, mas este projeto não tem nenhuma ligação ou conexão com Dogecoin. Para proteger a comunidade Dogecoin de ser induzida em erro e para proteger o nome da Dogecoin de ser usado indevidamente, nós pedimos aos nossos advogados de proteção de marca para contatar os criadores do produto &amp;lsquo;Dogecoin 2.</description></item><item><title>Claims of Affiliation with Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/advisories/2020-08-18-not-affiliated-moonrabbit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/pt/advisories/2020-08-18-not-affiliated-moonrabbit/</guid><description>Neither the Dogecoin project, the Dogecoin Foundation or any affiliated developers or entities have partnered with MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu or any affiliated entities, including the purported Dogecoin Foundation using the domain doge.org. This purported organisation and domain are, as far as we have been able to ascertain, run by the same people who run MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu.
As such, any claim of &amp;ldquo;partnering up&amp;rdquo; appears to be designed to create a false appearance of partnership and association with the long-established Dogecoin project and Dogecoin Foundation.</description></item></channel></rss>
