Some of you may remember that in June around my birthday I was invited by members of the Foundation for dinner in Austin. It was an absolutely amazing evening getting to know these people in person.</description></item><item><title>Shibes raise more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) to build a statue of the Doge!</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/blog/2022-12-06-bronzethedoge-success/</guid><description>In celebration of Kabosu the Doge&amp;rsquo;s 17th birthday, shibes around the world have raised more than 1,000,000 Dogecoin ($100,000) in donations which will be used to create a bronze statue of Kabosu in her home city of Sakura, Japan. Kabosu&amp;rsquo;s owner, Atsuko Sato was kind enough to reach out to Sakura city council, who support the idea of including the statue in their 2024 project to revitalise Furusato Square.
The funds which were raised have been moved into a multisignature wallet and now the work to make the statue of our beloved Doge a reality begins.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation to join the wDoge DAO</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-09-12-wdoge-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-09-12-wdoge-bridge/</guid><description>You may have heard talk about bridges in crypto, and recently in relation to Dogecoin.If you search around online for bridges to any major blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum you’ll find plenty of them.
So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin? Much like a physical bridge connects two locations, a crypto bridge connects two blockchains together to allow interaction: usually to allow one coin to be used on the other side of the bridge.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the Inaugural Dogecoin Hackathon</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/</guid><description>G&amp;rsquo;day shibes everywhere!
The Dogecoin Foundation is delighted to announce that registrations are now open for the 2022 Dogeathon Downunder hackathon in sunny Australia (or online) kicking off on Nov 15th.
https://dogecoin.com/dogeathon/
We&amp;rsquo;re inviting devs of all skill levels to join us to #HackTheDoge with a 4 day hackathon involving prizes, much fun, and adventure as we build the Dogecoin Ecosystem together!
Taking place in the Yarra Ranges, Australia, with online-participation available for global participants, the Dogeathon will showcase the power of Dogecoin&amp;rsquo;s new and old integration solutions - LibDogecoin, GigaWallet API, Core API, Doge-Eth Bridge, &amp;amp; more - as we BUIDL the future of the Peoples&amp;rsquo; Cryptocurrency, and increase the surface area of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin.com redesign ready for preview and feedback</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-06-15-website-relaunch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-06-15-website-relaunch/</guid><description>Nine months ago we set about building a community group to overhaul the old dogecoin.com website, and create a team who could collectively work on any future websites for Dogecoin.
After putting out the call for volunteers on Reddit and Twitter we gathered a group of around 20 Shibes with a wide variety of talents: from writing and translation, to HTML, CSS and graphic design.
Since then the team, beginning with foundation.</description></item><item><title>Shanties, RadioDoge &amp; Financial Freedom</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/blog/2022-04-11-shanty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/blog/2022-04-11-shanty/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the rousing tale of the whalers from Otakou and the Weller Bros trading company that plied its wares amongst them during the 1800s.
What you may not know is that the workers in these stories were often enticed with promises of a good wage, only to find themselves intentionally indebted to trading cooperatives who controlled 100% of the housing, equipment, trade and basic necessities in these remote regions.</description></item><item><title>Ross Nicoll Stepping into an Advisor Role for the Dogecoin Foundation</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-02-24-update-ross/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-02-24-update-ross/</guid><description>Recently Ross made public his decision to step back from involvement in the Foundation as a Director and more generally from active development in the crypto space.
While this is news to many in the community, Ross had made his intentions clear to the Core developers almost a year ago and has been working quietly behind the scenes to create a sustainable transition for his role in the Dogecoin project.</description></item><item><title>Let's talk about Development</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/</guid><description>I know that for non-devs (or ‘not-yet-devs&amp;rsquo; 😉), it can sometimes be difficult to make sense of technical talk. I think that a part of my job as an Engineer at the Dogecoin Foundation is to explain technical things in terms non-tech folk can understand. Because of this, I’d like to ramble a bit about the Trailmap, about the goals we have and the projects that we’re hoping will fulfil them.</description></item><item><title>Dogecoin Foundation Update &amp; AMA on January 23rd, 2022</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/announcements/2022-01-21-update-ama/</guid><description>The Dogecoin Foundation, established and led by members of the original core development team and long-time members of the Dogecoin community, has responsibility for providing advocacy and support for the Dogecoin cryptocurrency project.
Since 2014, the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s sole mission has been to protect and support the Dogecoin project, its reputation, and the global community of Shibes. The Foundation is committed to ensuring that Dogecoin continues to thrive, and can ultimately scale to being a widely used currency whilst simultaneously tackling changes at a pace that keeps-up with other cryptocurrencies.</description></item><item><title>專案：Dogecoin Standard 狗狗幣標準</title><link>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/trailmap/standard/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://foundation.dogecoin.com/zh-tw/trailmap/standard/</guid><description>專案：Dogecoin Standard 狗狗幣標準 狗狗幣發展路線圖：序言 專案：Dogecoin.com 改造 &amp;amp; Dogepedia 狗狗幣百科 專案：Libdogecoin 專案：Dogecoin Standard 狗狗幣標準 專案：GigaWallet 專案：Dogecoin Keyring (App / SDK) 專案：RadioDoge (Starlink + Radio nodes for remote locations) 提案：Community Staking (Proof of Stake) 合作：Point of Sale (L2 app) 狗狗幣標準 ── 一份詳細規範. 狗狗幣標準將會是一份明文規範和用於驗證的測試套件，它衍生自 Dogecoin Core Wallet（狗狗幣核心錢包），在我們建立 libdogecoin 的過程中誕生。 狗狗幣標準的目標是為參考實作 / reference implementation（即 Core Wallet）製作完整的文件，填補時常被詢問的「白皮書」空缺之處，並提供說明文件給任何想瞭解狗狗幣如何運作的人。
最近我們發現到，對一些交易所來說，讓狗狗幣錢包正常運作不是那麼容易，而且現在要理解狗狗幣的運作方式你必須閱讀程式碼，或是從初期早就在狗狗幣專案參與其中。藉由撰寫狗狗幣文件，我們想達成的目標是多面向的：
為開發人員降低進入的門檻. 嘗試讓更多開發者加入狗狗幣社群時，我們遇到的一個情況是：即便對資深開發者來說，學習曲線也相當陡峭。目前我們做的幾乎是指著比特幣的開發文件說「跟這有點像但又有些不同」，除非有 ross/michi/pat/max 帶著你手把手教學，否則不太有幫助。透過建立起針對開發者設計的文件，我們希望可以大大增加來到狗狗幣領域的開發者人數，這對大家都有益處。
建構於規範之上的功能測試套件. 標準很棒，但除非他們可以被證實，否則也站不住腳。建構狗狗幣標準的過程裡，其中一部分將會是創建一個伴隨而來的測試套件，它將能有效地測試任何狗狗幣應用實作，並可以驗證它們是否符合規範。
這對多樣的狗狗幣生態系來說是一個很大的加速器：當我們對節點和錢包的實作做了變動，能立即驗證它在目前的生態系統裡是否還正常運作，如此大家都能前進地更快。
社群提案進程. 狗狗幣協議將首次被獨立於 Core Wallet（核心錢包）外的方式實作並呈現。這將提供社群機會，透過 DIPs（Dogecoin Improvement Proposals，狗狗幣改善提案）一起創造強健的改善進程。改善提案可以在真正被採用的一段時間前，先在社群中被廣泛討論，以及與關鍵的利害關係人們共同探討。</description></item></channel></rss>
